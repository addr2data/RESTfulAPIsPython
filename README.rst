- Send me your GitHub username.
- Add your public SSH key to your GitHub account (generate new keys if necessary).
- Create a new repo for this training.
- Do a little research and decide where you want to write Python. I use Sublime Text (Python aware text editor). You could also use an IDE (PyCharm is very common).
