Working with RESTful APIs in Python
===================================

Getting Started
---------------
- Make sure you have Python (3.8.1 or later), Pip (latest) and Git installed.
- If you donâ€™t have a GitHub account, please create one.
- Send me your GitHub username.
- Add your public SSH key to your GitHub account (generate new keys if necessary).
- Create a new repo for this training.
- Do a little research and decide where you want to write Python. I use Sublime Text (Python aware text editor). You could also use an IDE (PyCharm is very common).
